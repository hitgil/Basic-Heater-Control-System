# Heater Control System â€“ Multi-Platform

This repository contains implementations of a temperature-based heater control system across different ESP32 configurations:

- **ESP32** branch: Standard implemLentation with FreeRTOS
- **ESP32-S2_FreeRTOS** branch: Optimized for the ESP32-S2 microcontroller

Please switch to the appropriate branch above to view code and simulation.

## Project Overview

The heater control system simulates an embedded temperature monitoring system using the DHT22 sensor and I2C LCD. It includes:

- Multi-core tasking via FreeRTOS
- Visual and serial feedback
- State-machine driven control logic

For details, refer to the respective branches.
